## How to Run the Code

1. Unzip the submitted `Batch-01_2025-Y2-S1-KU-120.zip` file.  
2. Navigate to the project directory: `Batch-01_2025-Y2-S1-KU-120`  
3. To view individual contributions:  
   - Open and run the notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder.  
   - Each notebook is named according to the team member responsible.  
4. To execute the full preprocessing pipeline:  
   - Open and run `notebooks/Batch-01_2025-Y2-S1-KU-120_pipeline.ipynb`.  
   - This will execute the entire integrated workflow and generate the final processed dataset in the `results/outputs/` folder.  
5. You can run the notebooks using **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**.
